Test Tasks
•	CRUD Functionality with Authentication
•	Build an ASP.NET MVC/Core application with a login system.
•	Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a Product entity with fields:
•	Id (int)
•	Name (string)
•	Price (decimal)
•	Quantity (int)
•	Ensure only logged-in users can perform CRUD operations.

•	Stored Procedures
•	Write and use stored procedures in MSSQL for the following operations:
•	Retrieve all products.
•	Insert a new product.
•	Update an existing product.
•	Delete a product.
•	Code Optimization Task
•	Write a C# function to parse a CSV file and return a list of objects. Each row in the CSV represents an object, and the headers correspond to object properties.
•	Ensure the function is efficient and handles errors gracefully.
•	Dapper ORM
•	Replace Entity Framework operations in the CRUD functionality with Dapper.
•	Use parameterized queries for secure and efficient database interactions.
